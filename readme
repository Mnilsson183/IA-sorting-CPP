International Baccalaureate Math Internal Assessment

This repository contains a copy of the code that I used in my International Baccalaureate (IB) Math Internal Assessment. The goal of the project was to investigate a mathematical topic of my choice and use data analysis and mathematical modeling to draw conclusions and make predictions.
I created a C++ program that tests the time complexity of various sorting algorithms. The program generates a large array of random integers and sorts them using several different algorithms, measuring the execution time of each algorithm and comparing their performance.
